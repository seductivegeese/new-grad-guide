## 👋Hello!

You&#39;re probably here because you are going to be starting a tech job in the US!

Adulting is hard and we&#39;re all trying to figure it out, so hopefully by sharing our experiences in what we hope to be a semi-coherent guide, we can make it easier for the next wave of new grads to start their careers.

Some guidelines to make this less chaotic as more people help out -

## Actual content below.

Congratulations on starting real-life! This is a guide to hopefully help you transition from being a student to working full-time in the tech industry in the US.

Adulting is hard and we&#39;re all trying to figure it out, so hopefully by sharing our experiences in what we hope to be a semi-coherent guide, we can make it easier for the next wave of new grads to start their careers.

_We&#39;re not legal, tax, immigration, etc. professionals. We take no responsibility for anything here, so please contact a professional if you&#39;re confused._

**Before You Sign…**

These are generally outside of the scope of this guide, but we&#39;re linking to a few useful resources to make sure you get the best offer possible!

- Guides to Negotiating an Offer
  - Doesn&#39;t hurt to negotiate! Companies _rarely_ revoke offers if you negotiate and if they do, that&#39;s probably a red flag. Job offers are just contracts - you should try and get what you think you&#39;re worth. If you don&#39;t think you need the money, that&#39;s totally fair! That&#39;s more that could go towards charity or whatnot.
- Stock Options vs RSUs
  - It&#39;s important to get clarification on the vesting schedule! Most companies withhold any stock grants until at least a year into your job (cliff) and the stocks are given over four years. Usually companies will offer you stocks evenly every quarter, but some companies will give you fewer stocks at the beginning of your vesting schedule (eg. Amazon).
  - [This](https://www.holloway.com/g/equity-compensation) is an important read on equity compensation.

**While you wait for the job start**

- Housing and Relocation
  - _For SF, Bay Area, NYC interns:_ Shit&#39;s expensive
  - Look into what relocation benefits your employer provides. They might provide cash, a reimbursable amount, temporary housing, or a mixture!
  - Try to actually see the place before you sign a lease. This isn&#39;t an internship anymore, you&#39;ll be living there for more than four months and you&#39;ll want to enjoy the space - a video tour can only do so much.
  - If you can&#39;t make it there though, try to send a friend for a video tour at the least.
  - For companies that offer more than one relocation package, do some relocation calculations to see which one gives you more $$. For example, some lump sum amounts results in waaay more money than asking the company to ship stuff for you. (This is especially applicable if you already live relatively close to the state you&#39;re traveling to and if you already have housing secured)
  - For Seattle(WA) interns who are going to Microsoft, they can also look for places that are close to &quot;connector&quot; stops, which is a free shuttle service provided by MS. Here&#39;s a link to a map w/ the stops:[https://www.bing.com/maps/?v=2&amp;cp=47.620098~-122.140800&amp;lvl=10&amp;dir=0&amp;sty=r&amp;cid=732976E630FC85AB!113&amp;form=LMLTCC](https://www.bing.com/maps/?v=2&amp;cp=47.620098~-122.140800&amp;lvl=10&amp;dir=0&amp;sty=r&amp;cid=732976E630FC85AB!113&amp;form=LMLTCC)
- Degree fast-track
  - If your start date is close to your graduating date, you might need to ask the Registrar&#39;s Office to fast-track your degree so that you can use it for your TN visa
  - Otherwise you have to wait until convocation when you receive your diploma
- Repaying Student Loans
  - OSAP
    - ■■While you won&#39;t have to make a repayment until 6 months after the end of your last academic term (likely April 30 + 6 mo, so October 31), interest will accrue on the Canadian portion immediately after the end of your term and the Ontario portion once repayments should begin (starting 2019, interest will also accrue on the Ontario portion once the grace period starts)
    - ■■The Ontario rate is prime (BoC) + 1%, Canada is prime + 2.5%, standard repayment is over 9.5 years
    - ■■Student Loan Interest payments can be claimed on your Canadian tax return as part of your non-refundable tax credits **while you&#39;re a Canadian resident**.

NOTE: &#39;Also, remains to be seen how big of a deal non-residency is, considering passing the Substantial Presence Test qualifies you as a US resident which would make you a non-resident of Canada per the US/Canada tax treaty.&#39;]

NOTE: &#39;&quot;Held in a retirement plan of which you&#39;re a participant or beneficiary&quot; is exempt, does that mean RRSPs are exempt?...&#39;]
Foreign Accounts (eg. TFSA, chequing or savings accounts, etc.) you MUST file a [FBAR form](https://bsaefiling.fincen.treas.gov/NoRegFBARFiler.html) with the details of these accounts annually by April 15.
  - **○○** Settling your Canadian Accounts
    - **■■** Generally, it&#39;s probably a good idea to consolidate your accounts as much as possible because it&#39;s less reporting to do (if you have to), there&#39;s less stuff to manage, and fewer moving parts in general.
    - **■■** Dividend investment accounts (fine in RRSPs if Cali didn&#39;t exist)
    - **■■** RRSP
      - You can hold a RRSP while a non-resident of Canada, although most (if not all) brokerages will heavily restrict/block your access to the account.
      - The IRS considers a RRSP as an equivalent to the 401k, so Federally you will not pay any tax on any income earned within the RRSP, although some states do not treat it this way
    - **■■** Does other states have other restrictions? We can cover the biggest cases (ie. NY, WA, CA)
      - California: CA does not treat a RRSP as a tax-deferred shelter, instead taxing it like a Margin account. If you&#39;re holding a RRSP, it&#39;s probably best if you invest in full-return securities (ie. those which don&#39;t provide a dividend).

Visa Considerations + Common FAQs about visa restrictions

  - **○○** Getting a H1B / Green card?
  - **○○** Side projects? Can&#39;t freelance/moonlight on a visa
  - **○○**** TN - The NAFTA visa**
    - **■■** If you&#39;re coming on a TN visa, you will need to have Canadian or Mexican citizenship, this is a nice option as H1-B visas are harder to get.
    - **■■** You also need to have a job offer with a qualified job description (not all jobs are under TN), and a degree that is relevant for that job. So unfortunately you cannot work as a designer if you have an AFM degree, for example, no matter your past work experience.
    - **■■** Also, consider setting your employment start date at least a month after your convocation date. While TN visa could technically be applied at the border with your offer letter and diploma, you risk getting rejected especially if the border agent think your degree is irrelevant for the job. **This is especially common for Computer Science students with a Software Engineering job offer.** Most companies will sponsor your TN visa and file a petition on your behalf for a pre-approval, and if approved, you will receive a I-797B notice of action. This would increase your chance of success at the border significantly. The petition may take a few weeks to process, so starting a bit later would avoid potential headaches here.
    - **■■** If you&#39;re applying at the border (rather than getting pre-approval from the US gov&#39;t) and you&#39;re from the Toronto area, the lawyers at EIG recommended going through Fort Erie, aka peace bridge, because Pearson and Detroit land crossing have a high rejection rate. I&#39;ve been there and it&#39;s pretty hectic so get there super early if you&#39;re flying from Buffalo!
      - Make sure to call ahead to see when the TN officers will be available, because sometimes they only work monday - friday 9-5 and if you arrive on the weekend, you&#39;ll be there for a long time
      - There&#39;s also a deferred inspections office in SF that will change your work status if they misclassify you at the border.
    - **■■**** IMPORTANT: **If your company is providing a legal team to apply for a TN visa for you, ask for a status update** 2 months** (or at least a 1.5 months) before your start date. Even after they&#39;ve collected all of your info, it could still take a long time for them to actually file the request for your visa, and it will then take another 15 days to hear back from the USCIS (this is NOT a guaranteed approval, they may ask for more evidence which will result in more time/delay). So you asking for a status update is just to make sure your legal team doesn&#39;t uh.. &#39;forget&#39; about you and file the visa request way too late. Some employers require you to receive your start authorization from the legal team a week prior to your start date, or else your start date will have to be pushed back.
    - **■■** Context: Many folks have gotten fucked by dumbass lawyers who were too busy vacationing and filed the request so fucking late that my start date had to get pushed back. This of course impacts your ability to sign a housing contract as you&#39;ll have no idea when you&#39;ll actually be able to move into the states
- Building a credit history in the US (pls start as an intern on coop if you can)
  - **○○** Having a credit history is useful when applying for long-term leases, loans, mortgages etc. It&#39;s good to start this early (ie. during Coop if possible) and to build a good history (ie. making your payments on time - ideally the full balance).
  - **○○** The easiest way to start is by opening a credit card (cards like Discover or student cards are apparently easier to get - Secured cards are also an option, Capital One&#39;s doesn&#39;t have an annual fee).
  - **○○** Try keeping your monthly credit card balance below 30% of your limit (by either lowering spending or increasing your limit, also pay off parts of your spending before a statement release) -- they use this as a factor when calculating your credit score

acronyms? (EPO, PPO, High Deductible)

    - **■■**** Copay:** When you receive a medical service, you have to pay the specified fee. There are different amounts for different services, and they should be outlined in the benefits package.
    - **■■**** Coinsurance:** When you receive a medical service, you have to pay a percentage of the medical bill.
    - **■■**** Deductible:** The amount of money you pay yourself before your healthcare plan starts paying for you (minus the copays/coinsurance fees). For example, if you have a health plan with a $250 annual deductible, then you are on the hook for the first $250 in fees. And then after that, you will only pay for the co-pay or co-insurance fees.

including all copays.
    - **■■**** In/Out of Network:** Insurance providers will partner with hospitals and clinics to provide a discount or exclusive service for you. If you go to these &quot;in-network&quot; providers, then it would be cheaper than if you went &quot;out-of-network:. More on this in a second.
    - **■■**** What about Canada/International?** You might qualify as out of network when you seek medical treatment abroad.
    - **■■**** Types of Health Plans**
      - EPO: This type of plans tend to favor the provider&#39;s network, with discounted/cheap fees if you stay in the network, and very expensive to no coverage if you leave the network.
      - PPO: This type of plans tend to favor the provider&#39;s network, with very low to no fees if you stay in the network, but you retain coverage if you leave the network.
      - HMO: See EPO. HMOs typically handle the full lifecycle of your healthcare. For example, if you have a Kaiser HMO, to remain in-network, you must visit a Kaiser GP, specialists, hospitals, etc. Typically, you will also have to see your GP for a referral to a specialist.
      - High Deductible Health Plans: You and your employer contribute money to an HSA (Healthcare Savings Account), which is used for your own medical expenses. The remaining funds will roll over every year, so this could be a good idea if your health is in a generally good shape. Downside: You generally will pay more money when you do claim insurance in the form of higher deductibles and coinsurance.
  - **○○** (Retirement) Savings
    - **■■** It&#39;s never too early to save for retirement / important investments such as a house later in life.
    - **■■**** 401k Matches and Vesting:**
      - Generally speaking, a 401k is tied to your current employer.
    - **■■** [**Traditional IRA**](https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/traditional-iras): You can think of a traditional IRA like a RRSP in Canada; it&#39;s a tax-deferred retirement account. Generally, you can only withdraw from the IRA after age 59½ without paying a tax penalty, but there are a number of [ther exemptions](https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-participant-employee/retirement-topics-tax-on-early-distributions) (eg. buying your first home).

NOTE: &#39;What is a TFSA! And implications for canadians leaving for the us&#39;]
TFSA, but it has more limitations. Like a TFSA, it&#39;s post-tax, but it is subject to the same tax penalties and exemptions as a traditional IRA (only the earnings are taxed the same way as traditional IRA, you can withdraw contributions anytime). The Roth IRA is not currently recognized under US/Canada tax treaty, so the treatment of a Roth if you become a Canadian resident is unclear. Some quick searches indicate that upon moving back to Canada, you must stop contributing to the Roth + declare it as an overseas pension to ensure tax-free growth and disbursements.
    - **■■** M E G A BACKDOOR
  - **○○** Various Pre-tax deductions
    - **■■**** Commuter Subsidy**: Many companies offer a pre-tax commuter account, which allows you to allocate pre-tax dollars towards commutes (usually transit, Uber Pool, Lyft Shared). Some even provide a monthly amount as a benefit.
    - **■■**** Flexible Savings Account (FSA):** A FSA is an account which allows you to set aside pre-tax dollars towards healthcare costs not paid for by insurance (ie. copays, coinsurance, deductibles, etc.). Employers may allow you to rollover up to $500 from one year to the next.
_Note:_ There is also a dependent-care FSA that is subject to different rules, which is not covered here.
_Note:_ FSAs are not available with all healthcare plans.
    - **■■**** Health Savings Account (HSA)**: A HSA is similar to a FSA in that you can save pre-tax dollars for healthcare expenses, with the difference that contributions are rolled over year-to-year. Your employer may contribute to your account under eligible healthcare plans.
_Note_: HSAs are usually only available with High Deductible Health Plans (HDHPs).
- Meetups, Conferences (_PD, but useful_)
  - **○○** Meetups (see: meetup.com / eventbrite.com) can be useful places to meet other people who have an interest in the things you do! While they&#39;re commonly used for tech-related topics like React, machine learning, or data science, there are many cool hobby-related ones too (like underwater basket weaving!)
  - **○○** Conferences can be a good place to meet other people, learn, and have fun! Some of these can get disorganized or flat-out preachy, so do your research before plopping hundreds of dollars on a ticket. Check with your manager to see if your company will cover your ticket or accomodations.
